note: For a dump of the path that led to this error, rerun with the environment variable `HAYBALE_DUMP_PATH` set to:
        `LLVM` for a list of the LLVM basic blocks in the path
        `SRC` for a list of the source-language locations in the path
        `BOTH` for both of the above
      To get source-language locations, the LLVM bitcode must also contain
      debuginfo. For example, C/C++ or Rust sources must be compiled with the
      `-g` flag to `clang`, `clang++`, or `rustc`.

note: For a dump of variable values at time of error, rerun with `HAYBALE_DUMP_VARS=1` environment variable.

note: to enable detailed logs, ensure that debug-level logging messages are visible.
  See the documentation for your chosen logging backend (e.g., env_logger, log4rs, etc)
  for help with configuration.
